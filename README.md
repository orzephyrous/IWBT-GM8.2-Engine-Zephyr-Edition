# IWBT-GM8.2-Engine-Zephyr-Edition
"I Wanna" engine developed in Gamemaker 8.2, based on IWBT studio engine yoyoyo edition v1.51, with some references to renex engine.

This is still a semifinished project. There will be a more detailed README when the engine is ready.


## Process

Finished the simple migration of codes. Changed method for encrypting saves and change sound-related stuffs to gm8.2snd functions.

I don't know how to deal with the controller stuffs, and I don't have one controller to test it.
