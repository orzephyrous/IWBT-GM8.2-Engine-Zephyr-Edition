# IWBT-GM8.2-Engine-Zephyr-Edition

"I Wanna" engine developed in Gamemaker 8.2, based on IWBT studio engine yoyoyo edition v1.51, with some references to renex engine.

This project is mostly finished. There will be a more detailed README when the engine is ready to release.

## Process

Finished the simple migration of codes. Changed method for encrypting saves and change sound-related stuffs to gm8.2snd functions.

Controller-related stuffs totally removed.

Don't want to add gimmicks. Maybe will add gimmicks in another branch.

## Acknowledgement

Thanks Ebb174 for testing this engine.
