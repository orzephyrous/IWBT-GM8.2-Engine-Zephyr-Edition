# IWBT-GM8.2-Engine-Zephyr-Edition

"I Wanna" engine developed in [Gamemaker 8.2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/87jc37aq3dgsp7b/gm82.7z?dl=0), based on [IWBT studio engine yoyoyo edition v1.51](https://github.com/YoYoYoDude/YoYoYo_Engine), with some references to [renex engine](https://github.com/omicronrex/renex-engine).

This project is mostly finished. There will be a more detailed README when the engine is ready to release.

## Process

Finished the simple migration of codes. Changed method for encrypting saves and change sound-related stuffs to gm8.2snd functions.

Controller-related stuffs totally removed.

Don't want to add gimmicks. Maybe will add gimmicks in another branch.

MusOnDeath (game over music) and related stuffs removed (plenty seconds of game over music is just not necessary).

## Acknowledgement

Thanks Ebb174 for testing this engine.
